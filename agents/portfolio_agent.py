DarvasTrader — Portfolio Agent
Phase 3: Python implementation (coming next)

This agent will:
- Read the current portfolio state
- For each holding evaluate:
  * CONTINUE: stock forming higher boxes → raise trailing stop
  * ADD: stock at 52W high while trending → generate add signal
  * EXIT: stop hit or floor violated → generate sell signal
- Log all decisions with timestamps and reasoning
